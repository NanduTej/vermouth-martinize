def make_partitions(items, test):
    """
    Partitions items into sets based on the outcome of ``test(item1, item2)``.
    Pairs of items for which `test` returns `True` end up in the same set.

    Parameters
    ----------
    items : collections.abc.Iterable[collections.abc.Hashable]
        Items to partition
    test : collections.abc.Callable[collections.abc.Hashable, collections.abc.Hashable]
        A function that will be called with 2 arguments, taken from items.
        Should return `True` if those 2 items need to end up in the same
        partition, and `False` otherwise.

    Returns
    -------
    list[set]
        A list of sets, with each set containing part of the items in `items`,
        such that ``all(test(*pair) for pair in  itertools.combinations(set, 2))
        == True``

    Notes
    -----
    The function `test` is assumed to be transitive: if ``test(a, b)`` and
    ``test(b, c)`` return ``True``, then ``test(a, c)`` must also be ``True``.

    ----------
    partitions: collections.abc.Sequence[collections.abc.Iterable]

        A collection of sets.

    Returns
    -------
    set
        An intersection of all sets in `collection_of_sets`. Will have the same
        type as the item initially taken from `collection_of_sets`.

class ISMAGS:
    """
    Implements the ISMAGS subgraph matching algorith. ISMAGS stands for
    "Index-based Subgraph Matching Algorithm with General Symmetries". As the
    name implies, it is symmetry aware and will only generate non-symmetric
    isomorphisms.

    Notes
    -----
    The implementation imposes additional conditions on the graphs provided and
    the comparison functions (:attr:`node_equality` and :attr:`edge_equality`):

     - Node keys in both graphs must be orderable as well as hashable.
     - Equality must be transitive: if A is equal to B, and B is equal to C,
       then A must be equal to C.

    Attributes
    ----------
    graph: networkx.Graph
    subgraph: networkx.Graph
    node_equality: collections.abc.Callable
        The function called to see if two nodes should be considered equal.
        It's signature looks like this:
        ``f(graph1: networkx.Graph, node1, graph2: networkx.Graph, node2) -> bool``.
        `node1` is a node in `graph1`, and `node2` a node in `graph2`.
        Constructed from the argument `node_match`.
    edge_equality: collections.abc.Callable
        The function called to see if two edges should be considered equal.
        It's signature looks like this:
        ``f(graph1: networkx.Graph, edge1, graph2: networkx.Graph, edge2) -> bool``.
        `edge1` is an edge in `graph1`, and `edge2` an edge in `graph2`.
        Constructed from the argument `edge_match`.

        ----------

            Function used to determine whether two nodes are equivalent. It's
